## Day 4 - Machine Learning Mastery:

First step to **understanding your data** is to use **descriptive statistics**.

Learn how to use descriptive statistics to understand your data. I recommend using the **helper functions** provided on the **Pandas** DataFrame.

--> Understand your data using the **head()** function to look at the first few rows.

--> Review the dimensions of your data with the **shape** property.

--> Look at the data types for each attribute with the **dtypes** property.

--> Review the distribution of your data with the **describe()** function.

--> Calculate pair-wise correlation between your variables using the **corr()** function.
