# MachineLearningMastery

## Day 1 - Machine Learning Mastery:

Installation of Anaconda, ( which includes python and required default packages installed in Anaconda IDE).

Checking the installed versions in jupyter notebook.

## Day 2 - Machine Learning Mastery:

Creating a Dataframe

## Day 3 - Machine Learning Mastery:

Load data from CSV files ( use standard ML datasets)

## Day 4 - Machine Learning Mastery:

First step to **understanding your data** is to use **descriptive statistics**.

Learn how to use descriptive statistics to understand your data. I recommend using the **helper functions** provided on the **Pandas** DataFrame.

--> Understand your data using the **head()** function to look at the first few rows.

--> Review the dimensions of your data with the **shape** property.

--> Look at the data types for each attribute with the **dtypes** property.

--> Review the distribution of your data with the **describe()** function.

--> Calculate pair-wise correlation between your variables using the **corr()** function.

## Day 5 - Machine Learning Mastery:

Second way to improve your **understanding of your data** is by using **data visualization** techniques (e.g. plotting).

Learn how to use plotting in Python to understand **attributes** alone and their interactions. Again, I recommend using the **helper functions** provided on the Pandas DataFrame.

--> Use the **hist()** function to create a histogram of each attribute.

--> Use the **plot(kind=’box’)** function to create box-and-whisker plots of each attribute.

--> Use the **pandas.scatter_matrix()** function to create pairwise scatterplots of all attributes.
